    <introduction>
        Over recent years there has been much interest in the field of distributional semantics, drawing on the distributional hypothesis: words that occur in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings (Harris,1954) ...
    <introduction>
    <corps>
       Lee (1999) noted that the substitutability of one word for another was asymmetric and proposed the alpha-skew divergence measure, an asymmetric ...

    <conclusion>
        We have shown that it is possible to predict to a large extent whether or not there is a specific semantic relation between two words given their distributional vectors ...
