Titre: A Scalable MMR Approach to Sentence Scoring for Multi-Document Update Summarization 

Auteurs: Florian Boudin , Marc El-Beze ♮

Abstract : We present SMMR, a scalable sentencescoring method for query-oriented up-date summarization. Sentences are scoredthanks to a criterion combining query rele-vance and dissimilarity with already readdocuments (history).As the amount ofdata in history increases, non-redundancyis prioritized over query-relevance.Weshow that SMMR achieves promising re-sults on the DUC 2007 update corpus.1

Discussion : In this paper we have described SMMR, a scal-able sentence scoring method based on MMR thatachieves very promising results. An important as-pect of our sentence scoring method is that it doesnot requires re-ranking nor linguistic knowledge,which makes it a simple and fast approach to theissue of update summarization. It was pointed outat the DUC 2007 workshop that Question Answer-ing and query-oriented summarization have beenconverging on a common task. The value addedby summarization lies in the linguistic quality. Ap-proaches mixing IR techniques are well suited forquery-oriented summarization but they require in-tensive work for making the summary fluent andcoherent. Among the others, this is a point that wethink is worthy of further investigation.
