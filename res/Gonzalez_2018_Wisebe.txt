Abstract : . Sentence Boundary Detection (SBD) has been a majorresearch topic since Automatic Speech Recognition transcripts have beenused for further Natural Language Processing tasks like Part of SpeechTagging, Question Answering or Automatic Summarization. But whatabout evaluation? Do standard evaluation metrics like precision, recall,F-score or classification error; and more important, evaluating an auto-matic system against a unique reference is enough to conclude how wella SBD system is performing given the final application of the transcript?In this paper we propose Window-based Sentence Boundary Evaluation(WiSeBE), a semi-supervised metric for evaluating Sentence BoundaryDetection systems based on multi-reference (dis)agreement. We evalu-ate and compare the performance of different SBD systems over a setof Youtube transcripts using WiSeBE and standard metrics. This dou-ble evaluation gives an understanding of how WiSeBE is a more reliablemetric for the SBD task.Keywords: Sentence Boundary Detection · EvaluationTranscripts · Human judgment1

Introduction : The goal of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is to transform spoken datainto a written representation, thus enabling natural human-machine interaction[33] with further Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Machine transla-tion, question answering, semantic parsing, POS tagging, sentiment analysis andautomatic text summarization; originally developed to work with formal writ-ten texts, can be applied over the transcripts made by ASR systems [2,25,31].However, before applying any of these NLP tasks a segmentation process calledSentence Boundary Detection (SBD) should be performed over ASR transcriptsto reach a minimal syntactic information in the text.To measure the performance of a SBD system, the automatically segmentedtranscript is evaluated against a single reference normally done by a human.

Torres-Morenogiven a transcript, does it exist a unique reference? Or, is it possible that thesame transcript could be segmented in five different ways by five different peoplein the same conditions? If so, which one is correct; and more important, howto fairly evaluate the automatically segmented transcript? These questions arethe foundations of Window-based Sentence Boundary Evaluation (WiSeBE), anew semi-supervised metric for evaluating SBD systems based on multi-reference(dis)agreement.The rest of this article is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we set the frame ofSBD and how it is normally evaluated. WiSeBE is formally described in Sect. 3,followed by a multi-reference evaluation in Sect. 4. Further analysis of WiSeBEand discussion over the method and alternative multi-reference evaluation ispresented in Sect. 5. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes the paper.

Corp : Sentence Boundary DetectionSentence Boundary Detection (SBD) has been a major research topic scienceASR moved to more general domains as conversational speech [17,24,26]. Per-formance of ASR systems has improved over the years with the inclusion andcombination of new Deep Neural Networks methods [5,9,33]. As a general rule,the output of ASR systems lacks of any syntactic information such as capital-ization and sentence boundaries, showing the interest of ASR systems to obtainthe correct sequence of words with almost no concern of the overall structure ofthe document [8].Similar to SBD is the Punctuation Marks Disambiguation (PMD) or SentenceBoundary Disambiguation. This task aims to segment a formal written text intowell formed sentences based on the existent punctuation marks [11,19,20,29]. Inthis context a sentence is defined (for English) by the Cambridge Dictionary1as:“a group of words, usually containing a verb, that expresses a thought inthe form of a statement, question, instruction, or exclamation and startswith a capital letter when written”.PMD carries certain complications, some given the ambiguity of punctuationmarks within a sentence. A period can denote an acronym, an abbreviation, theend of the sentence or a combination of them as in the following example:The U.S. president, Mr. Donald Trump, is meeting with the F.B.I.director Christopher A. Wray next Thursday at 8 p.m.However its difficulties, DPM profits of morphological and lexical informationto achieve a correct sentence segmentation. By contrast, segmenting an ASRtranscript should be done without any (or almost any) lexical information anda flurry definition of sentence.1 https://dictionary.cambridge.org/.WiSeBE: Window-Based Sentence Boundary Evaluation121The obvious division in spoken language may be considered speaker utter-ances. However, in a normal conversation or even in a monologue, the way ideasare organized differs largely from written text. This differences, added to disflu-encies like revisions, repetitions, restarts, interruptions and hesitations make thedefinition of a sentence unclear thus complicating the segmentation task [27].Table 1 exemplifies some of the difficulties that are present when working withspoken language.Table 1.

A segment was considered to begin eitherat the beginning of an utterance, or after the end of the preceding segment. Anydysfluency between the end of the previous segments and the begging of currentone was considered part of the current segments.Rott and ˇCerva [23] aimed to summarize news delivered orally segmenting thetranscripts into “something that is similar to sentences”. They used a syntacticanalyzer to identify the phrases within the text.A wide study focused in unbalanced data for the SBD task was performedby Liu et al. [15]. During this study they followed the segmentation scheme pro-posed by the Linguistic Data Consortium2 on the Simple Metadata AnnotationSpecification V5.0 guideline (SimpleMDE V5.0) [27], dividing the transcripts inSemantic Units.2 https://www.ldc.upenn.edu/.122C.-E. Gonz´alez-Gallardo and J.-M. Torres-MorenoA Semantic Unit (SU) is considered to be an atomic element of the transcriptthat manages to express a complete thought or idea on the part of the speaker[27]. Sometimes a SU corresponds to the equivalent of a sentence in written text,but other times (the most part of them) a SU corresponds to a phrase or a singleword.SUs seem to be an inclusive conception of a segment, they embrace differentprevious segment definitions and are flexible enough to deal with the majorityof spoken language troubles. For these reasons we will adopt SUs as our segmentdefinition.2.1Sentence Boundary EvaluationSBD research has been focused on two different aspects; features and methods.Regarding the features, some work focused on acoustic elements like pausesduration, fundamental frequencies, energy, rate of speech, volume change andspeaker turn [10,12,14].The other kind of features used in SBD are textual or lexical features. Theyrely on the transcript content to extract features like bag-of-word, POS tags orword embeddings [7,12,16,18,23,26,30]. Mixture of acoustic and lexical featureshave also been explored [1,13,14,32], which is advantageous when both audiosignal and transcript are available.With respect to the methods used for SBD, they mostly rely on statisti-cal/neural machine translation [12,22], language models [8,15,18,26], conditionalrandom fields [16,30] and deep neural networks [3,7,29].Despite their differences in features and/or methodology, almost all previouscited research share a common element; the evaluation methodology. Metrics asPrecision, Recall, F1-score, Classification Error Rate and Slot Error Rate (SER)are used to evaluate the proposed system against one reference. As discussedin Sect. 1, further NLP tasks rely on the result of SBD, meaning that is crucialto have a good segmentation. But comparing the output of a system against aunique reference will provide a reliable score to decide if the system is good orbad?Bohac et al. [1] compared the human ability to punctuate recognized spon-taneous speech. They asked 10 people (correctors) to punctuate about 30 min ofASR transcripts in Czech. For an average of 3,962 words, the punctuation marksplaced by correctors varied between 557 and 801; this means a difference of 244segments for the same transcript. Over all correctors, the absolute consensus forperiod (.) was only 4.6% caused by the replacement of other punctuation marksas semicolons (;) and exclamation marks (!). These results are understandable ifwe consider the difficulties presented previously in this section.To our knowledge, the amount of studies that have tried to target the sentenceboundary evaluation with a multi-reference approach is very small. In [1], Bohacet al. evaluated the overall punctuation accuracy for Czech in a straightforwardmulti-reference framework. They considered a period (.) valid if at least five oftheir 10 correctors agreed on its position.WiSeBE: Window-Based Sentence Boundary Evaluation123Kol´aˇr and Lamel [13] considered two independent references to evaluate theirsystem and proposed two approaches. The fist one was to calculate the SER foreach of one the two available references and then compute their mean. Theyfound this approach to be very strict because for those boundaries where noagreement between references existed, the system was going to be partially wrongeven the fact that it has correctly predicted the boundary. Their second app-roach tried to moderate the number of unjust penalizations. For this case, aclassification was considered incorrect only if it didn’t match either of the tworeferences.These two examples exemplify the real need and some straightforward solu-tions for multi-reference evaluation metrics. However, we think that it is possibleto consider in a more inclusive approach the similarities and differences that mul-tiple references could provide into a sentence boundary evaluation protocol.3Window-Based Sentence Boundary EvaluationWindow-Based Sentence Boundary Evaluation (WiSeBE) is a semi-automaticmulti-reference sentence boundary evaluation protocol which considers the per-formance of a candidate segmentation over a set of segmentation references andthe agreement between those references.Let R = {R1, R2, ..., Rm} be the set of all available references given a tran-script T = {t1, t2, ..., tn}, where tj is the jth word in the transcript; a referenceRi is defined as a binary vector in terms of the existent SU boundaries in T.Ri = {b1, b2, ..., bn}(1)wherebj =�1 if tj is a boundary0 otherwiseGiven a transcript T, the candidate segmentation CT is defined similar to Ri.CT = {b1, b2, ..., bn}(2)wherebj =�1 if tj is a boundary0 otherwise3.1General Reference and Agreement RatioA General Reference (RG) is then constructed to calculate the agreement ratiobetween all references in. It is defined by the boundary frequencies of each ref-erence Ri ∈ R.RG = {d1, d2, ..., dn}(3)where124C.-E. Gonz´alez-Gallardo and J.-M. Torres-Morenodj =m�i=1tij∀tj ∈ T,dj = [0, m](4)The Agreement Ratio (RGAR) is needed to get a numerical value of the dis-tribution of SU boundaries over R. A value of RGAR close to 0 means a lowagreement between references in R, while RGAR = 1 means a perfect agreement(∀Ri ∈ R, Ri = Ri+1|i = 1, ..., m − 1) in R.RGAR = RGP BRGHA(5)In the equation above, RGP B corresponds to the ponderated common boundariesof RG and RGHA to its hypothetical maximum agreement.RGP B =n�j=1dj [dj ≥ 2](6)RGHA = m ×�dj∈RG1 [dj ̸= 0](7)3.2Window-Boundaries ReferenceIn Sect. 2 we discussed about how disfluencies complicate SU segmentation. In amulti-reference environment this causes disagreement between references arounda same SU boundary. The way WiSeBE handle disagreements produced by dis-fluencies is with a Window-boundaries Reference (RW ) defined as:RW = {w1, w2, ..., wp}(8)where each window wk considers one or more boundaries dj from RG with awindow separation limit equal to RWl.wk = {dj, dj+1, dj+2, ...}(9)3.3W iSeBEWiSeBE is a normalized score dependent of (1) the performance of CT over RWand (2) the agreement between all references in R. It is defined as:WiSeBE = F1RW × RGARWiSeBE = [0, 1](10)where F1RW corresponds to the harmonic mean of precision and recall of CTwith respect to RW (Eq. 11), while RGAR is the agreement ratio defined in (5).RGAR can be interpreted as a scaling factor; a low value will penalize the overallWiSeBE score given the low agreement between references. By contrast, for ahigh agreement in R (RGAR ≈ 1), WiSeBE ≈ F1RW .WiSeBE: Window-Based Sentence Boundary Evaluation125F1RW = 2 × precisionRW × recallRWprecisionRW + recallRW(11)precisionRW =�bj∈CT 1[bj = 1, bj ∈ w∀w ∈ RW ]�bj∈CT 1[bj = 1](12)recallRW =�wk∈RW 1[wk ∋ b∀b ∈ CT ]p(13)Equations 12 and 13 describe precision and recall of CT with respect to RW .Precision is the number of boundaries bj inside any window wk from RW dividedby the total number of boundaries bj in CT . Recall corresponds to the numberof windows w with at least one boundary b divided by the number of windowsw in RW .4Evaluating with W iSeBETo exemplify the WiSeBE score we evaluated and compared the performanceof two different SBD systems over a set of YouTube videos in a multi-referenceenvironment. The first system (S1) employs a Convolutional Neural Network todetermine if the middle word of a sliding window corresponds to a SU bound-ary or not [6]. The second approach (S2) by contrast, introduces a bidirectionalRecurrent Neural Network model with attention mechanism for boundary detec-tion [28].In a first glance we performed the evaluation of the systems against eachone of the references independently. Then, we implemented a multi-referenceevaluation with WiSeBE.4.1DatasetWe focused evaluation over a small but diversified dataset composed by 10YouTube videos in the English language in the news context. The selected videoscover different topics like technology, human rights, terrorism and politics witha length variation between 2 and 10 min. To encourage the diversity of contentformat we included newscasts, interviews, reports and round tables.During the transcription phase we opted for a manual transcription processbecause we observed that using transcripts from an ASR system will difficultin a large degree the manual segmentation process. The number of words pertranscript oscilate between 271 and 1,602 with a total number of 8,080.We gave clear instructions to three evaluators (ref1, ref2, ref3) of how seg-mentation was needed to be perform, including the SU concept and how punctu-ation marks were going to be taken into account. Periods (.), question marks (?),exclamation marks (!) and semicolons (;) were considered SU delimiters (bound-aries) while colons (:) and commas (,) were considered as internal SU marks.The number of segments per transcript and reference can be seen in Table 2. Aninteresting remark is that ref3 assigns about 43% less boundaries than the meanof the other two references.126C.-E. Gonz´alez-Gallardo and J.-M. Torres-MorenoTable 2.

In general, it can be seen that S1predicts 27% more segments than S2. This difference can affect the performanceof S1, increasing its probabilities of false positives.Table 3.

If we focus on F1 scores, performance of bothsystems varies depending of the reference. For ref1, S1 was better in 5 occasionswith respect of S2; S1 was better in 2 occasions only for ref2; S1 overperformedS2 in 3 occasions concerning ref3 and in 4 occasions for mean (bold).Also from Table 4 we can observe that ref1 has a bigger similarity to S1 in5 occasions compared to other two references, while ref2 is more similar to S2in 7 transcripts (underline).After computing the mean F1 scores over the transcripts, it can be concludedthat in average S2 had a better performance segmenting the dataset comparedto S1, obtaining a F1 score equal to 0.510. But... What about the complexity ofthe dataset? Regardless all references have been considered, nor agreement ordisagreement between them has been taken into account.All values related to the WiSeBE score are displayed in Table 5. The Agree-ment Ratio (RGAR) between references oscillates between 0.525 for v8 and 0.767for v5. The lower the RGAR, the bigger the penalization WiSeBE will give tothe final score. A good example is S2 for transcript v4 where F1RW reaches avalue of 0.800, but after considering RGAR the WiSeBE score falls to 0.462.It is feasible to think that if all references are taken into account at the sametime during evaluation (F1RW ), the score will be bigger compared to an averageof independent evaluations (F1mean); however this is not always true. That isthe case of S1 in v10, which present a slight decrease for F1RW compared toF1mean.WiSeBE: Window-Based Sentence Boundary Evaluation127Table 4.

If evalu-ated without considering any (dis)agreement between references (F1mean), S2overperforms S1; this is inverted once the systems are evaluated with WiSeBE.5

Discussion : 5.1RGA R and Fleiss’ Kappa correlationIn Sect. 3 we described the WiSeBE score and how it relies on the RGAR valueto scale the performance of CT over RW . RGAR can intuitively be consider anagreement value over all elements of R. To test this hypothesis, we computedthe Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) [21] between RGAR and the Fleiss’Kappa [4] of each video in the dataset (κR).A linear correlation between RGAR and κR can be observed in Table 6. Thisis confirmed by a PCC value equal to 0.890, which means a very strong positivelinear correlation between them.5.2F 1mean vs. W iSeBEResults form Table 5 may give an idea that WiSeBE is just an scaled F1mean.While it is true that they show a linear correlation, WiSeBE may produce a128C.-E.

Conclusion : ConclusionsIn this paper we presented WiSeBE, a semi-automatic multi-reference sentenceboundary evaluation protocol based on the necessity of having a more reliableway for evaluating the SBD task. We showed how WiSeBE is an inclusive metricwhich not only evaluates the performance of a system against all references, butalso takes into account the agreement between them. According to your pointof view, this inclusivity is very important given the difficulties that are presentwhen working with spoken language and the possible disagreements that a tasklike SBD could provoke.WiSeBE shows to be correlated with standard SBD metrics, however wewant to measure its correlation with extrinsic evaluations techniques like auto-matic summarization and machine translation.Acknowledgments.
