  <discussion>In this paper we have described SMMR, a scal-able sentence scoring method based on MMR thatachieves very promising results. An important as-pect of our sentence scoring method is that it doesnot requires re-ranking nor linguistic knowledge,which makes it a simple and fast approach to theissue of update summarization. It was pointed outat the DUC 2007 workshop that Question Answer-ing and query-oriented summarization have beenconverging on a common task. The value addedby summarization lies in the linguistic quality. Ap-proaches mixing IR techniques are well suited forquery-oriented summarization but they require in-tensive work for making the summary fluent andcoherent. Among the others, this is a point that wethink is worthy of further investigation.</discussion>
